# learningPHP

This is a basic php system with login, itemization, and image storing functionality.
While it is not recommended that a large amounts of images
be used in a database due to unneccessary load, this is just a proof of concept.




Config:
These files were used in order to streamline the connection process and provide basic login info without having to type it out in every file


Session:
This protocol was used to check the login status for every page in order to ensure the security of every page.



MySQL:

While it is possible to make the code compatible for all databases, this one primarily uses MySQL. I have used PDO in order to show that
the code works regardless of dialect. A few conversions are needed to change the code entirely to accommodate all server setting




-A Note on this project:

Please forgive the lack of documentation and commenting on the code. I am still working on the code and the final revision will be 
updated soon with comments and complete documentation and a step-by-step explaination of the programming logic used in this code.
